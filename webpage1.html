  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>Hi, my name is Gabrielle, but most people call me Gabby. I'm from Long Island, NY and I am currently in my senior year of high school. My favorite thing to do during my free time is go for a jog.</p>


  <h4>Hobbies</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Running/ Track & Field</li>
    <p>I have been on the varsity track and field team at my school for 4 years. I usually run long distance events (ex: 1500m and 800m), but my first year on the team my coaches had me run sprinting events.</p>

    <li>Music</li>
    <p>My main instrument is the clarinet. I learned how to play the clarinet in the third grade. I learned how to play the piano and the tenor saxaphone two years later.</p>
